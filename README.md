# Google-Matrix
This is for Google Distance Matrix API, it takes in a .csv called 'postcodes.csv' from the same directory, checks the distance between the postcodes (1st and 2nd row) **specifically using the roads** NOT as the crow flies, then outputs a .csv called 'postcodes_with_distances.csv' with appended distance in the 3rd row. 

Replace the <INSERT_API_HERE> with your own Google Distance Matrix API key.
